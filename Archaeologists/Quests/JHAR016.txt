QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>         We've received a tip concerning a supposed Dwemer
<ce>   object of some kind in a cave. Whoever goes for it should
<ce>   be prepared for a trap of some kind. I have here a
<ce>   magical _reward_ if you'll do us the honors.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>       We need to learn how to motivate our people better.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>      We're sending you to ___dung_. The artifact
<ce>   will resemble a torc, we're informed. Its continued
<ce>   existence in the face of such rarity means it'll spring
<ce>   some sort of trap on you, no doubt. Be prepared for anything.
<ce>   Return here within three months for your reward.

<ce>              "Stuck to you? Hold on."
<ce>   
<ce>   _questgiver_ calls for help, and a few
<ce>   other members of the guild rush in.
<ce>   Various enchantments fly through the air,
<ce>   and the torc falls off.
<ce>   
<ce>   "I hope your reward is worth it. Our senior members
<ce>   will relish this opportunity."

Message:  1010
<ce>           You reach for the artifact, and it jumps
<ce>  onto you! It latches onto your body. Nothing
<ce>  you try can separate itself from you.
<ce>  It begins to emanate some sort of noxious gas.
<ce>  For your own well-being, you should get this back to
<ce>  the Archaeologists quickly.

Message:  1011
<ce>         The artifact emits a burst of light,
<ce>   and a guardian materializes to defend it from you.

Message:  1012
<ce>   You have run out of time to deliver the
<ce>   artifact to the Archaeologists. It seems
<ce>   to have lost enough power by now, and you separate
<ce>   it from your body. It now lies inert.

 The Archaeologists of ___questgiver_
 have tasked me with delivering them
 an artifact of apparent Dwemer origin,
 with the appearance of a common torc,
 found in ___dung_. I have three months
 to ensure it reaches their hands.
 I should be wary of any traps it holds.

Message:  1031

 This artifact seems cause disease to whatever
 possesses it. The only permanent cure is to
 get rid of it.
