<ce>             Good day. We have an ancient document
<ce>             that needs to arrive in ___goalplace_ intact
<ce>             within =2goalplace_ days, under guard.
<ce>             We can spare =gold_ gold pieces for expenses.
<ce>             Are you up to the task?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>              Then let me see what else I have.

<ce>             The poor thing is centuries old, but it'll be preserved
<ce>             well enough for you to find _goal_. Find %g2 in
<ce>             ___goalplace_. I don't know where %g1 is. You'll
<ce>             get the expense payment from %g2.
<ce>             
<ce>             Also please keep it close to your person. Word is
<ce>             already out about its existence. Its age will attract
<ce>             persons of the lowest quality. Be going now, and
<ce>             take no more than =2goalplace_ days.

<ce>             Welcome, good friend. Ah, this is that page
<ce>             I was informed of? Marvelous. I was starting to
<ce>             doubt its existence altogether. Well then, let
<ce>             me get you your payment. =gold_ gold pieces,
<ce>             just as I agreed. Off you go then. Thank you.
