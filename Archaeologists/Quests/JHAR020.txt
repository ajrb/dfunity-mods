<ce>  It won't pay much, but we need someone to deliver
<ce>  a map to one of our higher ranked members.
<ce>  I don't anticipate any fighting on this one,
<ce>  besides the normal peril of the road.
<ce>  Are you interested?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>  This would get your foot in the door, %pct.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>  Fine enough. You'll need to deliver it to one
<ce>  =member_ who's staying in _tavern_,
<ce>  found in ___tavern_.
<ce>  He'll be heading out to some expedition
<ce>  after =timer_ days have passed, so be sure
<ce>  he has it before then. He mentioned it's
<ce>  absolutely vital. Expect =reward_ gold
<ce>  for your payment. Safe journey.

QuestFail:   [1003]
<ce>  You needed to deliver the map to the
<ce>  =member_ in ___tavern_ by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>  Hello there. Yes, I'll take that. Thank you.
<ce>  Are you a new member of the guild? How long
<ce>  have you been with us? Stick with it for
<ce>  a while. Those locator devices are absolutely
<ce>  worth it. They've saved my hide more times
<ce>  than I want to admit.
<ce>  
<ce>  Are you from around here?
<ce>  I've been all across Tamriel, but the one place
<ce>  I want to go before I retire is Morrowind.
<ce>  I've heard about all kinds of tombs and ruins over
<ce>  there. Just imagine the treasure and history
<ce>  for a skilled archaeologist in that area.
<ce>  Give it some thought. I'd need to save up for the trip,
<ce>  but I have to go sooner or later. And if you
<ce>  end up heading there, ask around for "Indie"
<ce>  and see if we don't bump into each other.
<ce>  Thanks, kid.
