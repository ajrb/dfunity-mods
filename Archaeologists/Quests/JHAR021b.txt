<ce>  Yer %pcn. Lord Spode says you're a barbarian.
<--->
<ce>  Wait, are you %pcn? People in Glenpoint say you have the manners of a donkey.
<--->
<ce>  Hey, you're %pcn! That one who's a spy for the Underking! Or was it the King of Worms?
<--->
<ce>  Wait, you're %pcn. You took out a bunch of loans you couldn't pay, didn't you?
<--->
<ce>  Hey, are you %pcn? Bertram Spode says you're a filthy liar.
<--->
<ce>  I hear talk of some %ra who's cheating all the merchants out of their goods.
<--->

  Lord Spode has no time to write to you, and demands
that I speak in his stead. He has encountered another
problem. His desire was that one of his properties in
____res_, ___res_, overcome its barren
nature and begin to yield all kinds of useful produce.
Sadly, the "good luck" finger, which we have begun
to question, sprouted up three spriggans
as an interpretation of "useful produce." We disagree
with the finger and need someone to clean out the
property. Lord Spode blames you for this and demands
that you go to it. Should you fail to do so within
=timer_ days, your reputation will be sullied.
Best of luck.

<ce> You can easily make out the three spriggans
<ce> stalking about the property. They groan and
<ce> march toward you.

 Lord Bertram Spode has made another poor decision
 with the "good luck" finger I delivered to
 him on behalf of the Archaeologists.
 He demands that I go
 to ___res_ of ____res_ and
 kill three spriggans which are now haunting
 his property. I have =timer_ days to do so,
 lest he ruin my reputation.

Message:  1016
<ce>  Lord Spode demanded that you kill the spriggans
<ce>  on his property by now.
