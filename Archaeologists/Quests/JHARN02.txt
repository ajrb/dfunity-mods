<ce>	The lion's share of our work goes to our own members.
<ce>    We have very high standards of trust and confidence,
<ce>    and you do not meet them.
<ce>
<ce>    You're lucky that we have a coded message here
<ce>    and no courier to deliver it. I think it's
<ce>    safe enough to trust someone like you.
<ce>    Deliver it, and you'll earn our esteem.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>	What are you then? A beggar? Shoo.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>	Good. I have things to do, so get going.
<ce>	This message is coded and will not be cracked
<ce>	by someone of your nature. It needs to get
<ce>	to one of our Professors, _person_
<ce>	who's staying in _tav_ of ___tav_.
<ce>	Have this done within =timer_ days,
<ce>	and not one later.

QuestFail:   [1003]
<ce>  The letter you carry needed to reach
<ce>  Professor _person_ of the Archaeologists by now.
<ce>  You discard it instead.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>	Who are you? Archaeologists? You're not...
<ce>	Oh. I guess our standards are dropping	of late.
<ce> Well, everyone has to start somewhere.
<ce>	I thank you for this letter. Do not inquire about
<ce>	its contents. Safe travels to you.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Well, you're humble enough to deliver a letter.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]

 _qgiver_ of the Archaeologists
 has sent me to deliver a
 coded message to _person_,
 a Professor who stays at
 _tav_ in ___tav_.
 It must arrive within =timer_ days.

Message:  1011
<ce>  This half-sheet of paper is covered in symbols.
<ce>  You wonder what kind of cipher it would take
<ce>  to read it.
