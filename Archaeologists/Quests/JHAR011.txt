QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce> We need someone who knows more than the basic
<ce> greeting grunts of Giantish. There is a document
<ce> waiting in another city that has lacked
<ce> translation for far too long. If you can do it,
<ce> I can pay you =reward_ gold. What do you say?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce> Good. Better not to lie about your capabilities.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce> One of our agents found the originals, which are being
<ce> held in storage, and made a copy now waiting in
<ce> ___town_. Look in _town_.
<ce> It contains a series of drawings around ____town_
<ce> which we hope will lead to something of interest.
<ce> I need not mention that the giants have a long history
<ce> in the Iliac Bay, so their input is of great worth.
<ce> Return here in =timer_ days with your explanation.

QuestFail:   [1003]
<ce> The Archaeologists required your translation
<ce> of the Giantish document by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce> Thank you for your time, %pct.

RumorsPostSuccess:   [1007]
There's a Giantish expert over in ___qgiver_.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt:
 _qgiver_, the Archaeologists,
 has assigned me to find a Giantish document
 in _town_ of ___town_
 and provide a translation. I have
 to return to ___qgiver_ within =timer_ days.

Message:  1020
<ce> This must be the copy left for you.

Message:  1021
<ce> Try as you might, the primitive scribbles and drawings
<ce> on this sheet mean absolutely nothing to you.

Message:  1022
<ce> Thankfully, the characters here are legible. A few
<ce> small insertions drawn near various landmarks show
<ce> a pattern of migration away from ___dung_.

Message:  1023
<ce> Your expert skill in Giantish brings out more details.
<ce> The characters all point to a forced migration due to
<ce> invading predators based in ___dung_.
<ce> Symbols suggesting "danger" and "death" are written near the
<ce> navigational lines. You get a rough sense for the century
<ce> this was written in.

Message:  1030
<ce> You have nothing to say, is that it?
<ce> You haven't even read the sheet yet.
<ce> Don't waste my time. Look at it first and then talk to me.

Message:  1031
<ce> You merely pretended to be an expert on Giantish? What a waste
<ce> of time. I presume you intended well, but the ignorant tend
<ce> to overestimate their abilities. I will take the document
<ce> and thank you for bringing it to me, but you will get
<ce> no pay. The whole point of this was the translation,
<ce> not a delivery service. This matter is concluded.

Message:  1032
<ce> I see, so their movement was leading away from
<ce> ___dung_? Interesting. Well, your skill
<ce> certainly speaks for itself. I'm happy to have enlisted
<ce> your aid in this matter.

Message:  1033
<ce> You have more to say? Tell on.
<ce> 
<ce> This explanation is fabulous. I will have to get this
<ce> information to some other experts in ____qgiver_.
<ce> Magnificent work. You didn't manage to find any other
<ce> clues about who the giants' predators were? Well,
<ce> at this point perhaps I'm getting greedy. This is an
<ce> important step forward. I believe this kind of
<ce> dedication demands a greater reward. Very well done.
