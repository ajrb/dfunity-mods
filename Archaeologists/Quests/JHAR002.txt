QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>               Good day. The Archaeologists encourage an
<ce>               adventuring spirit, in proper moderation, of course.
<ce>               Nevertheless, occasionally we have a new recruit
<ce>               who, now trained to explore the great wild world,
<ce>               forgets such basic skills as remembering how to find
<ce>               the exit in a deep, dark cave. Would you be willing
<ce>               to go look for _rescue_, who has
<ce>               entirely disappeared within ___dung_?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>               Do you not remember those first
<ce>               terrifying experiences, %pcf?
<--->
<ce>               At this rate, %crn is going to
<ce>               investigate us for these disappearances.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>               Thank you, %pcf, truly. I will admit we
<ce>               don't have a reward meted out for this
<ce>               action, but I will see what I can do while
<ce>               you're out. Please bring %g2 here in
<ce>               no more than =timer_ days. Otherwise I will
<ce>               have to inform the surviving family, and our
<ce>               shame will be indelible. Best of luck.
<ce>               And while you're coming out of
<ce>               ___dung_, would you be able
<ce>               to teach _rescue_ a thing or
<ce>               two about exploration and survival? It will
<ce>               likely save us all some trouble down the road.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>               Dear _rescue_, what a relief it is to
<ce>               see you. We have a great deal of training to give you
<ce>               before you'll be doing any spelunking on your own.
<ce>               After all, not everyone can handle themselves
<ce>               like %pcn, now can they? Once again, thank you,
<ce>               %pct. We don't have a material reward available,
<ce>               but what say I make mention of this on your guild record?
<ce>               I'm certain it'll help you reach promotion a little quicker,
<ce>               if nothing else. I hope that compensates the trouble.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
_rescue_ hasn't been around for a long time.
<--->
Them Archaeologists are irresponsible.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
_rescue_ hasn't been around for a long time.
<--->
_rescue_'s family is furious with the Archaeologists.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
I hear _rescue_ is in good shape now. Good thing.
<--->
I hope my children never want to join the Archaeologists.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Welcome, %pcf. _rescue_ says hello as well.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
Have you seen _rescue_, %pcf? Oh, of course not.

 _qgiver_ of the Archaeologists
 needs me to find _rescue_
 in ___dung_. I have
 =timer_ days to find %g2 and
 return to ___qgiver_.

Message:  1011
<ce>                 _rescue_ looks thoroughly ashamed.
<ce>                 
<ce>                 "I told them it wouldn't be necessary.
<ce>                 How long have I been down here?"
<ce>                 
<ce>                 You beckon for %g2 to follow, and %g1
<ce>                 stands behind you without further argument.
<--->
<ce>                 _rescue_'s eyes look
<ce>                 hollow and full of despair.
<ce>                 
<ce>                 "The exit's gone. It was right here. I'm sure of it.
<ce>                 Now we'll never get out. We're both trapped here."
<ce>                 
<ce>                 You strong-arm %g2 into following
<ce>                 you, and %g1 keeps silence.

<ce>                    Without a word, _rescue_ heads off
<ce>                    in the direction of ___qgiver_.
