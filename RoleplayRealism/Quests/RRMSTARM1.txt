<ce>__fort_ is no longer on alert for you, and have locked the doors.
<ce>You have failed to rescue _armorer_ from his predicament in the
<ce>____fort_.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>Excellent work Master, I'm so pleased that 
<ce>you managed to rescue _armorer_ from 
<ce>__fort_ all the way out here in the
<ce>____fort_. I feel much better now 
<ce>that the sitution has been resolved
<ce>so satisfactorily.
<ce>
<ce>It's been an absolute privilege to watch someone 
<ce>of your experience and expertise at work, Master 
<ce>%pcl. I can certainly see why you're a master  
<ce>of the guild. Please do pop in and say hello if you're
<ce>ever up in these mountains again, won't you?
<ce>
<ce>[You make a note of where _armorer_ said he  
<ce> was headed to in your notebook, and say goodbye]

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
<ce> The guards over at the __fort_
<ce> in ____fort_ have such fancy 
<ce> armor. I wonder where they get such 
<ce> workmanship?

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
<ce> You're that %ra that rescued the master
<ce> armorer _armorer_ from 
<ce> __fort_. Bloody nobility. Think
<ce> they can treat commoners like dirt and
<ce> get away with it. Praise be for champions
<ce> like you who help the common folk.

On %qdt:
 I met with _contact_ of the Fighters Guild
 in __guild_ who told me about the rumors regarding 
 a master armorer called _armorer_ who has not 
 been seen for a long time.
    I'm investigating to see if I can find out where 
 these troops with fine armor are from, what's going 
 on, and whether or not it's connected with %g3 
 disappearance.

Message: 1011
on %qdt:
 I have found the armorer, _armorer_. He is  
 trapped at __fort_ in servitude to a noble called
 _lord_. He and his troops seem to be nothing
 more than brigands and renegades, and you suspect 
 this lord is probably the disgraced or illegitimate
 son of some noble family somewhere. 
    They have kept the smith trapped by taking out a 
 contract with the Dark Brotherhood and threatening his 
 daughter with death. Fighting the entire garrison at the 
 fort is unlikely to be possible, so I need to get hold of 
 this contract to free _armorer_ from the villainous 
 clutches of _lord_. Maybe I should pay my guild
 contact in __guild_ a visit to see if a meeting with 
 the Dark Brotherhood can be arranged.
    Alternatively, _lord_ has agreed to release
 the smith if I pay the ridiculous sum of a million 
 gold pieces.

Message: 1012
on %qdt:
 My guild contact in __guild_, _contact_, 
 has arranged a meeting for me with the Dark 
 Brotherhood over in __dbTavern_. 
    They will wait for me in a tavern called 
 _dbTavern_. Look for someone called 
 _dbContact_.

Message: 1013
on %qdt:
 At a meeting with a representative of the Dark
 Brotherhood I discovered that this contract is 
 unsanctioned. Due to my good standing with the 
 Dark Brotherhood, they are going to deal with 
 this renegade swiftly, retrieving the contract 
 and delivering it directly to me within the week. 
 Whoever this transgressing member is, they're 
 about to regret ever having taken money from 
 _lord_ against the code of their order!

Message: 1014
on %qdt:
 At a meeting with a representative of the Dark
 Brotherhood I discovered that this contract is 
 unsanctioned. The brotherhood met with me out 
 of respect for my rank in the Fighters Guild, 
 but they are not going to deal with this 
 transgressing brother until they're ready to do 
 so, which is not quick enough for my purposes. 
    However, I have been permitted to retrieve 
 the contract myself on the understanding that I 
 do it quietly without hurting any other members 
 in the process. If I do, there will be costly 
 consequences. I should be able to find the 
 renegade member at __dbHideout_ 
 in _dbHideout_.

Message: 1015
on %qdt:
 Thankfully I was able to release _armorer_ from
 his entrapment by _lord_ at __fort_.
 He has headed south to a small town called Pjiga in
 the Mournoth region to set up a new forge and teach
 an apprentice.

Message: 1016
on %qdt:
 Thankfully I was able to release _armorer_ from
 his entrapment by _lord_ at __fort_.
    He has headed west to a small town called Penmore
 in Glenpoint to set up a new forge and teach an

 Paponirea in Tigonus to set up a new forge and

Message: 1018
on %qdt:
 My guild contact in __guild_, _contact_, 
 has employed some local rangers to locate the source
 of these well-armored warriors the locals are talking
 about.
    My contact will send me a letter once the trackers
 return, which should be in around 5 days time.

Message: 1019
on %qdt:
 My guild contact in __guild_, _contact_, 
 has given me his notes made from the eyewitness accounts
 of three reliable witnesses, hopefully giving clues to
 the wherabouts of the mysterious troops and their leader.

Message: 1020
<ce>[A guard to your left speaks to you as you enter]
<ce>
<ce>Hey, who're you? What're ya doing 'ere an' whaddya ya 
<ce>want %ra? Yeah, over 'ere on your left! Oy, you deaf?
<ce>
<ce>You'd best go 'n speak to _captain_ immediately!
<ce>

<ce>an' red cape, you can't miss 'im. Keep ya weapons 
<ce>sheathed and don't try any funny stuff, or we'll 
<ce>'ave your guts fer garters.

Message: 1021
<ce>[A guard behind you sees you speaking and calls out]
<ce>
<ce>Hey, what are you doing in there? You've made a big 
<ce>mistake, we don't take kindly to trespassers here.
<ce>
<ce>You'll not leave here alive %ra...

Message: 1022
<ce>[As you slice through yet another of their number, the lord shouts]
<ce>
<ce>%oth! This bloody %ra's a Daedra in human form or something...  
<ce>
<ce>EVERYONE STOP!
<ce>
<ce>We surrender Master %pcl. 
<ce>
<ce>Take _armorer_ and just leave, he's not worth the
<ce>loss of so many warriors for, no matter how good the 
<ce>armor he makes is.

Message: 1023
<ce>Argghhh. You're going to pay in blood for that, %ra!

Message: 1024
<ce>You've arrived back at __fort_ but you failed to retrieve the
<ce>contract from the renegade Dark Brother. You only have two
<ce>options left to rescue _armorer_, either pay the 1 million gold 
<ce>gold or fight an entire garrison of soldiers. Neither option is
<ce>particularly appealing.

Message: 1025
<ce>The warriors of __fort_ and their leader are enraged and will
<ce>be searching for you for the next couple of days

Message: 1026
<ce>You've found __fort_ out here in the hills, way off the
<ce>beaten track and miles away from anywhere else. They must
<ce>have rebuilt the place from an old ruin, as you can see
<ce>signs of repairs. There are also indications that a large
<ce>group is living at the fort, and significant construction
<ce>has taken place relatively recently. You suspect the fort 
<ce>cellars have been converted to a barracks. This place is 
<ce>likely to be more dangerous than it might appear at first.

Message: 1027
<ce>Eyewitness reports regarding the finely armored warriors 
<ce>seen in the region recently from _contact_.
<ce>
1: While out with his sheep, a shepherd from Moorton Farm
  had a few sheep 'confiscated' by a group of well-armored 
  'knights'. The sheep pastures are to the east of their
  farm and the warriors headed off that way.
<ce>
2: A well dressed, but rude '_captain_' insisted on 
  buying all the wine from the Hawking Orchard cheaply. He 
  was backed up by several rough looking men in fine armor. 
  They appeared to take the wine barrels towards the south.
<ce>
3: A funeral procession headed for the Masterhart Graveyard
  was forced off the road by a unit of well-armed men 
  heading northeast. They showed absolutely no concern or 
  respect for either the funeral goers, or the deceased.

<ce>What's this, a mangy %ra?
<ce>
<ce>You think you can just barge in here and speak to me?
<ce>
<ce>Captain, have the guards chase this idiot out of here!

Message: 1031
<ce>So, you're here from the Fighters Guild? I'm sure my
<ce>captain has told you to behave yourself, see that 
<ce>you do so else my guards get some free training.
<ce>
<ce>Does the guild need help from us with something?
<ce>I might consider it for a large fee.
<ce>
<ce>Come on, what do you want? Out with it!

Message: 1032
<ce>Who makes our armor? Haha. 
<ce>Well, who made your armor, %ra?
<ce>
<ce>That's a bit of an impertinent question, but there's a 
<ce>simple answer. We have our own armorer, of course.
<ce>
<ce>Does that surprise you, that we have such a fine smith all
<ce>the way out here in the middle of nowhere? You city types
<ce>are so arrogant. No, he doesn't want to work for anyone
<ce>else, and I won't allow him to freelance.
<ce>
<ce>You're out of luck.

Message: 1033
<ce>Do you have something else to discuss with me? No?
<ce>Then get out of my face and stop bothering me, %ra.

Message: 1034
<ce>So _armorer_ wishes to leave does he? Bah! 
<ce>Who would craft our armor then, I ask you? How would  
<ce>we protect ourselves from invaders, eh? No, %ra, 
<ce>he's staying right where he is.
<ce>
<ce>Tell you what. I'm not an unreasonable man. If you cover 
<ce>the expense of hiring a new armorer, then I'll release him.
<ce>I'd say about 1 million gold would suffice. That will be 
<ce>rather difficult you say? Don't worry, I take credit notes.
<ce>
<ce>[He smirks and waves you away]

Message: 1035
<ce>What? You actually got... hmmm, yes, that's about enough.
<ce> 
<ce>All right then, I’ll release _armorer_. You got quite the
<ce>bargain there guildmaster! Now take him and get out of here.
<ce>
<ce>[He can barely contain his amusement and mirth]

Message: 1036
<ce>%oth! How the hell did you get hold of that? 
<ce>
<ce>The Brotherhood has failed me, curse them. Seems I  
<ce>underestimated you %ra. 
<ce>
<ce>Okay, fine then, take _armorer_ with you!
<ce>
<ce>We're going to miss his craftmanship but I know when the 
<ce>game is up. Just know that your seniority within the 
<ce>Fighters Guild is the only reason you're even leaving 
<ce>here alive. I suggest that you don't ever cross our path 
<ce>again, %ra.

Message: 1037
<ce>Get out of here. Begone!

Message: 1038
<ce>You were warned to not approach _lord_ before
<ce>before speaking to _captain_ first.
<ce>
<ce>Do you want to ignore this advice?

Message: 1040
<ce>What business do you have with us, %ra?
<ce>
<ce>Well, well. A Master of the Fighters Guild you say?
<ce>
<ce>We have no issues with the Fighters Guild, 
<ce>so let's keep it that way, eh?
<ce>
<ce>You may move around our fortress freely and speak
<ce>with our lord. But, don't cause any trouble or do
<ce>anything stupid as we won't hesitate to cut you
<ce>down, representative of the Fighters Guild or not.

Message: 1041
<ce>Where do we get such fine quality armor? Well you're 
<ce>a nosey %ra aren't you? I'm not going to answer that,  
<ce>ask our lord, but I suggest you tread carefully.

Message: 1042
<ce>You want _armorer_? I warn you, _lord_ 
<ce>has become quite attached to our armorer  
<ce>and his craftmanship.

Message:  1043
<ce>If not for the beef it would start with the Fighters  
<ce>Guild, I'd have the men carve you open like a pig.  
<ce>Just take the damn smith and get out of here. 
<ce>
<ce>We don't ever want to see you again.

Message: 1044
<ce>Where did you get that from? Damn you, _lord_
<ce>is going to be in a bad mood for weeks. Curses on you
<ce>and your pox ridden guild. 

Message: 1048

<ce>[He glances nervously over your shoulder as you speak..]
<ce>
<ce>Who the hell are you? Go away, or you'll get me into trouble.
<ce>I can't want to be seen talking to you.

Message: 1052
<ce>I overheard a guard saying that you were asking the lord 
<ce>about me. Franky, I'm amazed you're still alive, and even 
<ce>more surprised you're able to wander freely about the 
<ce>place. Seems like it might be safe to talk to you then.
<ce>
<ce>I'm _armorer_ and I'm trapped here, Master %pcl. 
<ce>
<ce>Been here for nearly two years now, making armor for these
<ce>damned bandits. Oh, don't let them fool you, their 'lord' is
<ce>not noble in any way. No, he's led this band of renegades
<ce>and cut-throats for years and they cleared out and setup
<ce>in this fort a few years back. They use it as a base, as 
<ce>it's pretty isolated up here in the mountains, they can 
<ce>operate from here with relative impunity.

Message: 1053
<ce>How did I end up trapped here you ask? Gambling and drinking.
<ce>
<ce>After my wife died and my daughter married, I decided to travel
<ce>some while I still could. So, I sold my forge, hung up my tools
<ce>and travelled around for several months before ending up in
<ce>these mountains. One night I was too deep in my cups, as I was
<ce>missing my wife something fierce, and started gambling with
<ce>some local lord. Seemed more like a ruffian, but he had money.
<ce>Ended up with quite the debt to this 'lord' and we came to an
<ce>arrangement where I would work crafting armor for him and his 
<ce>men to pay off the debt.

Message: 1054
<ce>Three months! It was only supposed to be for three months.
<ce>
<ce>But when the time was up, and I started preparing to
<ce>leave, they surrounded me and told me I was going 
<ce>nowhere. I knew I couldn't fight my way out alone, so I
<ce>began to make plans to sneak out and escape, but the 
<ce>captain came and made it very clear that if I were to go 
<ce>missing, that my daughter would die. This cursed 'lord' 
<ce>has paid the Dark Brotherhood for a contract on her, to 
<ce>be carried out on his word if I go missing. That damnable 
<ce>cut-throat son of a bitch knew he had me, and I've been
<ce>here ever since.
<ce>
<ce>My daughter's all I have left now, since my wife passed. 
<ce>She lives with her husband, farming peacefully. I'll never  
<ce>let her come to harm, which means I am trapped here in 
<ce>servitude until I die, unless some miracle occurs.

Message: 1055
<ce>How on earth did you get hold of the contract, %pcf?
<ce>Bloody hell, that doesn't matter - maybe tell me later, the 
<ce>important thing is you've given me my freedom back. Thank 
<ce>the heavens, you're my savior. I'll be ready to leave just
<ce>as soon as you've shown it to _lord_, so he 
<ce>knows that his scheme is dead and buried then we can
<ce>be on our way.

Message: 1058
<ce>%oth %ra, you're crazy! 
<ce>You'll never beat a whole garrison by yourself. 
<ce>Dibella have mercy on your soul.

Message: 1059
<ce>%oth! Thank you so much, %pcf. 
<ce>
<ce>I never thought the day would come!
<ce>Come on, let's get the hell out of here.

-- Guild Contact
Message: 1060
<ce>Welcome to __guild_, Master %pcl.
<ce> 
<ce>My name is _contact_ and I'm very pleased
<ce>to see you here indeed, since the situation we have   
<ce>is a rather perplexing one to say the least.
<ce>
<ce>We've been hearing rumors of a local noble whose soldiers 
<ce>and personal guard have been seen clad in unusually fine 
<ce>armor. Thing is, no one knows anything much about this
<ce> 'noble'. Not where he resides or what family he's from.
<ce>
<ce>I've been looking into the matter for a while now, and
<ce>have found three reliable locals who've witnessed 
<ce>them firsthand and gathered their accounts.

Message: 1061
<ce>I've taken the liberty of making inquiries with a 
<ce>local group of rangers about tracking down these  
<ce>soldiers and their mysterious leader. Unfortunately,   
<ce>expertise like this doesn't come cheap, and it will 
<ce>cost 7000 gold pieces to engage their services. 
<ce>
<ce>Alternatively, you could try to search for the 
<ce>location yourself. I can give you my notes with    
<ce>accounts provided by the three reliable local
<ce>eye-witnesses, which is all we have to go on.
<ce>
<ce>So, would you like me to employ the trackers? 
<ce>I'll obviously need you to provide the 7000 
<ce>gold to cover their price, if that's okay?

Message: 1161
Do you want to cancel hiring the rangers and try to
track them based on local accounts?

Message: 1062
<ce>Fair enough, it's not a trivial sum so I understand not 
<ce>wanting to spend that much. Here you go, here are my
<ce>notes made when speaking to the three witnesses.
<ce>
<ce>Good luck and let me know if you need any help once you
<ce>track down these troops and their leader, and hopefully 
<ce>also discover a bit more about the situation. Do tread 
<ce>carefully, I doubt that they'll be very forgiving if you 
<ce>anger them from the sound of the reports.

Message: 1063
<ce>Alright then, I'll get in touch with the trackers and have
<ce>them start as soon as you return with the money, assuming 
<ce>you still want to proceed. They don't accept letters of 
<ce>credit, so you need to bring me real gold pieces.

Message: 1064
<ce>Thank you for bringing the gold, Master %pcl. I'm glad
<ce>not to have to cover the cost from my own meagre pocket.
<ce>
<ce>I'll contact the trackers and have them start their search 
<ce>immediately. They said that with the vague directions and 
<ce>such a large and inhospitable area to cover, it would likely
<ce>take about a week to cover the area. Once I hear from 
<ce>them, I shall send you a letter with their findings.

Message:  1065
<ce>A youthful redguard, wearing mismatched pieces of 
<ce>worn armor, steps confidently up to you with a
<ce>letter in his calloused hand.
<ce>
<ce>"Letter from the Guild, Master %pcl."
        <--->
<ce>A scarred nord woman briskly walks up to you. She shifts
<ce>one of her many weapons aside, pulls out a crumpled letter
<ce>and thrusts it into your hands before striding away.
        <--->
<ce>An armored argonian slithers up to you. They hold 
<ce>hold up a letter in one claw and hiss at you,
<ce>"I erect the spine of greeting, Master %pcl." 
<ce>before passing you the letter. They take a pace
<ce>back, bow, and then swiftly disappear into the crowd.

Message: 1066
Master %pcn,
 
    Great news, the trackers we employed have found where
the noble and his warriors are. Turns out they've taken up
residence in an old fortified monastery somewhere east of 
__guild_. It is in the hills, way off the beaten track, 
and miles away from anywhere.
<ce>
    They must have rebuilt the place somewhat, as by all 
accounts it's been rundown for several generations to the 
point where most local people are not even aware of its 
existence. 
<ce>
    The place is called __fort_ and I've enclosed
a map of how to reach it. Good luck and let me know if
you need any help once you uncover a bit more about the 
situation. Tread carefully, I doubt that they'll be very
forgiving if you anger them.
 
<ce>                           Yours sincerely,
 
<ce>                            _contact_

Message: 1067
<ce>What? A Dark Brotherhood contract on his daughter?
<ce>That's obscene!
<ce>
<ce>I will setup a meeting for you with the brotherhood,
<ce>as they should be willing to at least meet with a 
<ce>master of our guild out of respect. However, whether 
<ce>they will help you is another matter entirely.
<ce>
<ce>Go to _dbTavern_ over in __dbTavern_, I'll
<ce>ensure that a representative will be waiting for 
<ce>you. Be careful around the dark brothers, they 
<ce>are not to be trifled with.

Message: 1068
<ce>I hope you're able to retrieve the contract and 
<ce>free _armorer_, %pcf. Remember, be careful around
<ce>the dark brothers, we want to keep on their good
<ce>side for the sake of the guild.

Message: 1069
<ce>Excellent work Master %pcl! 
<ce>
<ce>So you have retrieved the contract and now you 
<ce>can free _armorer_. That's fantastic news.
<ce>
<ce>Bring him back here, so we can help arrange a nice  
<ce>quiet place for him to live. I'm sure we can find 
<ce>somewhere suitable.

-- Rescued armorer
Message: 1070
<ce>Welcome to __guild_, _armorer_. 
<ce>Please accept our help after your ordeal.
<ce>
<ce>Master %pcl, we will help him get back on his 
<ce>feet and set up home with a new forge in a small 
<ce>town somewhere nice and quiet.
<ce>
<ce>Where would you like to settle down, _armorer_?
<ce>
<ce>We're assuming someplace far away from the 
<ce>____guild_...

Message: 1071
<ce>I'm not sure. To tell you the truth I'm just 
<ce>grateful to be away from that cursed place and 
<ce>out of _lord_'s clutches at last.
<ce>
<ce>I'm forever in your debt Master %pcl!
<ce>
<ce>Hmm, I think that I will settle somewhere peaceful with
<ce>a new forge and finally take on an apprentice. I really
<ce>should pass on my skills before I get too old, you know. 
<ce>I'm certainly tired of crafting armor myself after the 
<ce>past couple of years. Teaching will make a nice change.
<ce>
<ce>I can always make an exception for you though, %pcf.
<ce>Although I can't ever repay you for rescuing me, I  
<ce>can forge custom armor for you once I'm settled down.
<ce>down. Please do drop in and see me anytime.
<ce>
<ce>Hmmm, so which direction shall I go?
<ce>What do you think, Master %pcl?
<ce>
<ce>Shall I head West, South, or maybe 
<ce>to the warmer South West?

Message: 1072
<ce>So do you think I should head South to  
<ce>find a place to settle?

Message: 1073
<ce>What do you think about me heading West to  
<ce>find somewhere to settle?

Message: 1074
<ce>Okay then maybe I should head South-West and 
<ce>find somewhere nice and warm to settle?

Message: 1075
<ce>Okay then %pcf, I've decided to head south and settle in
<ce>a small town called Pjiga in the Mournoth region. Please
<ce>drop by any time you're in the area or if you need some
<ce>particular armor crafted. You will always be welcome in
<ce>my forge.
<ce>
<ce>Goodbye and thanks again!

Message: 1076
<ce>Okay then %pcf, I'm going to head west and settle in

<ce>my forge.
<ce>
<ce>Goodbye and thanks again!

Message: 1077
<ce>Okay then %pcf, I'm going to head south west to the sun

-- Dark Brother contact
Message: 1080
<ce>Greetings Master %pcl. Thank you, and your guild also,
<ce>for bringing this to our attention. We were previously 
<ce>unaware of this contract, which you say has been taken 
<ce>out on a peasant woman as a means of blackmailing her
<ce>father who's another commoner of no real consequence, 
<ce>however skilled he may be at crafting armor. 
<ce>
<ce>Although the uninformed may think the Dark Brotherhood
<ce>a simple group of killers for hire, nothing could be
<ce>farther from the truth. A contract is a holy communion
<ce>between us and our Dark Queen. To allow it to be used 
<ce>for leverage in a labor dispute is beneath us.
<ce>
<ce>Our wayward member will have known this and, if they  
<ce>truly followed our code, would have refused the money.
<ce>It seems that greed has corrupted them enough to sell
<ce>unsanctioned contracts in the name of the Brotherhood.

Message: 1081
<ce>You do not need to sully your own blade with this renegades
<ce>blood, %pcn. Since you're a good friend of the brotherhood, 
<ce>we will deal with this matter swiftly for you, and deliver
<ce>the heretical contract directly to you within the next
<ce>few days. We ask simply that when you have no more need of 
<ce>this document, you will destroy this affront to our order.

Message: 1082
<ce>We will deal with this renegade brother at some point
<ce>and the contract will be void, but we do not feel any 
<ce>urgency regarding the situation. There are many more  
<ce>important machinations and intrigues to deal with first. 
<ce>
<ce>You have our permission to go and deal with our wayard 
<ce>member in the meantime. Be warned, however, do not harm
<ce>any others of our order while doing this, else we will 
<ce>hunt you down and exact vengence.
<ce>
<ce>Given the circumstances, we may make an exception for a hefty
<ce>price, but if you are unable to pay, then there's nothing we
<ce>can do and you will die.
<ce>
<ce>You will find this greedy traitor at _dbHideout_ 
<ce>in __dbHideout_.

Message: 1083
<ce> Reaching into your pack for something,
<ce> you spy a note that was not there before.
        <--->
<ce> You feel a parchment slip into your hand and hear
<ce> the sound of footsteps scampering away. There is 
<ce> no other sign of the mysterious courier.
        <--->
<ce>A girl steps forward saying
<ce>"Letter for you %pcn."
<ce>She hands you a note before sprinting away.

Message: 1090
<ce>A contract between _lord_ and the Dark Brotherhood.
<ce>It stipulates conditions for _lord_ to have
<ce>_armorer_'s daughter murdered in the case of him 
<ce>leaving _fort_ without _lord_'s permission.

Message: 1091
<ce>You engage the renegade in conversation, putting them at
<ce>ease using your knowledge of street level language and
<ce>customs. As soon as their guard drops, you skillfully
<ce>make a blindingly fast strike to the throat, crushing
<ce>their windpipe. As the body sags, you catch it and
<ce>quietly lower it to the floor. No one else has been
<ce>alerted, so now you can retrieve the contract and leave. 

Message: 1092
<ce>You sneak behind the renegade without them seeing you.
<ce>As soon as you are close enough, you skillfully pilfer
<ce>the contract without detection.

Message: 1093
<ce>You sneak behind the renegade without them detecting you.
<ce>As soon as you are close enough, you skillfully stab
<ce>them through the back of the neck, severing the spine
<ce>and straight through the throat. As they sag to the floor,
<ce>gurgling blood, you catch the body and quietly lower it.
<ce> No one else has been alerted, so now you can now
<ce>retrieve the contract and leave. 

Message: 1094
<ce>[You try to catch the renegade out, but are not skilled enough]
<ce>
<ce>You should not have come here. I don't like unexpected
<ce>guests. My mates and I will cut you into little pieces.
